# MY PROFILE

I have never met a single human being more qualified for your job opportunity than myself. I have kicked ass at four consecutive summers of full-time software engineering internships. I am master of a litany of hard skills and ha earned high praise for my leadership, teammate, and interpersonal skills.

People walk up to me on the street and ask "Alek, how are you so good at everything you do?" I smile, flash my beautiful green eyes, and tell them it comes naturally.
